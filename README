"GraphQL in aggregating and querying data from multiple sources with a single query."

GraphiQL Interface:

    Once the server is running, you can visit http://localhost:5000/graphql in your web browser.
    This will open the GraphiQL interface, where you can interactively run GraphQL queries.

Example Query:

    In the GraphiQL interface, you can run a query like the following:

    graphql

query {
  userData(userId: 1) {
    profile {
      id
      name
      email
    }
    activities {
      activity
      timestamp
    }
    logs {
      message
      timestamp
    }
  }
}

If everything is set up correctly, you should receive a response similar to:

json

        {
          "data": {
            "userData": {
              "profile": {
                "id": 1,
                "name": "John Doe",
                "email": "john@example.com"
              },
              "activities": [
                {
                  "activity": "Logged in",
                  "timestamp": "2023-08-13T12:34:56Z"
                }
              ],
              "logs": [
                {
                  "message": "User logged in",
                  "timestamp": "2023-08-13T12:34:56Z"
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        }
